# Output Directory

This directory is used for storing locally generated files and processing outputs. It is intentionally kept empty in the repository and ignored by Git.

## Purpose

- Temporary processing files
- Generated video frames
- Extracted audio files
- Analysis results
- Any other output from the video processing pipeline

## Note

The contents of this directory are not tracked in Git and will not be pushed to the repository. This is intentional to:
1. Avoid cluttering the repository with generated files
2. Prevent large binary files from being committed
3. Keep processing outputs local to each installation

You can safely use this directory for any output files generated by the pipeline.
