# Ingestion Module

This folder contains code and utilities for video and audio ingestion.  
The goal is to load video files, extract frames and audio streams, and collect basic metadata (e.g., duration, resolution).

**Typical tasks:**
- Reading video files using FFmpeg or OpenCV
- Extracting audio tracks for transcription
- Collecting video metadata for downstream processing

If you want to add a new video format or improve extraction speed, this is the place to do it.
