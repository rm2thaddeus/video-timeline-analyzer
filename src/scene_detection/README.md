# Scene Detection Module

This folder contains logic for segmenting videos into scenes.  
Scene detection is essential for dividing a video into meaningful chunks for analysis.

**Typical tasks:**
- Detecting scene boundaries using PySceneDetect or OpenCV
- Refining scene segmentation parameters
- Outputting scene start/end times for use in other modules

If you want to experiment with new scene detection algorithms, add them here.
