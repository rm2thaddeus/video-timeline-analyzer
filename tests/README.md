# Tests Folder

This folder will contain unit and integration tests for the project.

**Typical tasks:**
- Writing tests for each module (ingestion, scene detection, audio, visual, metadata, db, UI)
- Running tests to ensure code correctness and reproducibility
- Using pytest as the default testing framework

If you add new features or fix bugs, add or update tests here to keep the project reliable.
