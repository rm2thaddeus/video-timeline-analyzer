# Video Timeline Analyzer: System Architecture

This document outlines the architectural design of the Video Timeline Analyzer, explaining component interactions, data flows, and technical decisions.

## 1. System Overview

The Video Timeline Analyzer is designed as a modular, pipeline-oriented application that processes video content through several sequential and parallel analysis steps to generate rich metadata and an interactive timeline interface.

### 1.1 Key Architectural Principles

- **Modularity**: Each component is self-contained with clear interfaces
- **Parallelization**: CPU and GPU-intensive tasks run concurrently when possible
- **Resilience**: Fallback mechanisms for all critical components
- **Extensibility**: Plugin-like architecture for adding new analyzers or UI components
- **Efficiency**: Smart caching and processing to handle large video files

## 3. Data Flow

### 3.1 Processing Pipeline

1. **Video Input** → Parse video file and extract basic metadata
2. **Scene Detection** → Segment video into distinct scenes
3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - **Audio Pipeline**: Extract audio → Transcribe → Analyze sentiment → Detect audio events
   - **Visual Pipeline**: Extract key frames → Generate captions → Detect faces → Analyze emotions → Create embeddings
4. **Data Fusion**: Combine audio and visual metadata, synchronize by timestamp
5. **Scoring**: Calculate "viral" score for each scene based on combined signals
6. **Storage**: Save all metadata to database with appropriate indexing
7. **UI Rendering**: Generate interactive timeline with all metadata displayed

### 3.2 Data Schema

The central data model revolves around Scene objects with associated metadata:

```python
class Scene:
    start_time: float  # In seconds
    end_time: float
    key_frames: List[Frame]
    transcript: List[TranscriptSegment]
    context_tags: List[str]
    captions: List[str]
    sentiment_score: float
    facial_emotions: Dict[str, float]  # emotion -> intensity
    audio_features: Dict[str, float]  # feature -> value
    viral_score: float
    embeddings: Dict[str, List[float]]  # embedding_type -> vector
```
