# Project Roadmap (De-Novo Branch)

## Overview

This roadmap defines the phases and milestones for the de-novo branch, focusing on documentation, design, and project rule creation.  
**No code will be added until all planning and rules are finalized and approved.**

---

## Phase 1: Documentation & Design

- [ ] Review and refine system architecture ([ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)), emphasizing the DataFrame-centric, variable-granularity approach.
- [ ] Complete technical specifications ([SPECIFICATIONS.md](SPECIFICATIONS.md)), including data models and alignment logic.
- [ ] Finalize development environment and setup documentation ([DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md](DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md)).
- [ ] Review and update all supporting documentation (e.g., [POWERSHELL_COMMANDS.md](POWERSHELL_COMMANDS.md), [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)).
- [ ] Document all scientific and reproducibility requirements.

**Milestone:** All documentation reviewed and approved by project stakeholders.

---

## Phase 2: Project Rule Creation

- [ ] Draft comprehensive Cursor project rules (see `.cursor/rules/cursorrules.mdc`).
- [ ] Review and refine rules for:
    - Code structure and modularity
    - Documentation and commenting standards
    - Testing and validation requirements
    - Environment and dependency management
    - Git/GitHub workflow and commit policies
    - Scientific rigor and reproducibility
    - Data management and privacy
- [ ] Approve and publish rules in the repository.

**Milestone:** Project rules finalized and published.

---

## Phase 3: Review & Planning for Implementation

- [ ] Hold review meeting(s) to ensure all documentation and rules are clear, complete, and actionable.
- [ ] Identify any gaps or ambiguities in the design or rules.
- [ ] Plan the transition to implementation (future phases to be defined after review).

**Milestone:** Project is ready for codebase bootstrapping, with a clear, documented, and rule-driven foundation.

---

## Review & Feedback

- Regular review meetings at the end of each phase.
- Issues and suggestions tracked via GitHub.
- All major decisions documented for reproducibility.

*This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves. The documentation- and rule-driven approach is central to all phases and milestones.*
