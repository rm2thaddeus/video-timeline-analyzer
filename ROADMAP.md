# Video Timeline Analyzer Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development path for the Video Timeline Analyzer project, providing a clear timeline of planned features, milestones, and progress tracking.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

- [x] Create GitHub repository
- [x] Set up initial documentation (README, ROADMAP)
- [ ] Establish project structure and architecture
