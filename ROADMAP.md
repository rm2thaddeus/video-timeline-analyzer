# Video Timeline Analyzer Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development path for the Video Timeline Analyzer project, providing a clear timeline of planned features, milestones, and progress tracking.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

- [x] Create GitHub repository
- [x] Set up initial documentation (README, ROADMAP)
- [x] Establish project structure and architecture
- [x] Set up dev environment configuration (requirements.txt, environment.yml) using the shared venv at "C:\WINDOWS\System32\pytorch-env"; ensure this designated environment is used consistently.
- [x] Address dependency management between PyTorch and Python to ensure smooth GPU integration
- [x] Implement GPU detection and utilization (diagnostic validated by test_gpu.py)
- [x] Write initial unit tests for GPU utilities
- [x] Create unit testing framework
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)

## Phase 2: Video Processing & Scene Detection (Weeks 2-3)

- [x] Implement video file ingestion module and integrate it into the processing pipeline
- [x] Implement scene detection using PySceneDetect and an OpenCV-based fallback; enhanced with a robust black screen detection mode (CUDA-optimized)
- [x] Create scene metadata extraction framework with complete timestamping and resolution details
- [x] Implement frame extraction for key moments with integration into the overall video pipeline
- [x] Set up FFmpeg integration for audio extraction (integrated with scene detection)
- [ ] Refine the data model for scene information (further enhancements planned)

## Phase 3: Audio Analysis & Transcription (Weeks 3-4)

- [x] Integrate OpenAI Whisper transcription with CUDA acceleration (including mixed precision processing)
- [x] Implement configurable model selection (tiny to large) with optimized parameters for accuracy
- [x] Develop subtitle generation with SRT outputs, precise timestamps, and automatic cleanup of intermediate audio chunks
- [x] Add support for WhisperX for word-level precision as an optional enhancement
- [ ] Optional: Implement speaker diarization
- [ ] Enhance audio feature extraction (volume, pitch, tone) and audio-based emotion detection
- [ ] Implement transcript sentiment analysis

## Phase 4: Visual Context Analysis (Weeks 5-6)

- [ ] Integrate CLIP for scene tag generation and visual embeddings
- [ ] Implement BLIP-2 for descriptive captions
- [ ] Develop facial detection and tracking and integrate DeepFace for emotion recognition
- [ ] Create visual metadata aggregation from multiple visual analysis sources
- [ ] Implement vector embeddings for scenes and set up semantic similarity search

## Phase 5: Data Fusion & Storage (Weeks 7-8)

- [ ] Design unified database schema (SQLite) for storing all metadata
- [ ] Implement JSON export/import functionality for data interchange
- [ ] Develop a "viral moment" scoring algorithm that aggregates audio, visual, and scene metrics
- [ ] Create a metadata fusion pipeline to synchronize audio, visual, and scene data
- [ ] Implement vector storage with FAISS/ChromaDB for semantic search
- [ ] Set up a caching mechanism for processed videos
- [ ] Develop a robust data versioning system

## Phase 6: User Interface Development (Weeks 9-11)

- [ ] Design UI wireframes and detailed mockups for an interactive timeline
- [ ] Implement a feature-rich video player component with segment navigation
- [ ] Develop an interactive timeline visualization with highlight markers for key moments
- [ ] Create an integrated subtitle overlay system
- [ ] Implement a comprehensive scene metadata display panel with analytics
- [ ] Develop intuitive navigation controls and search functionality for the timeline
- [ ] Refine the UX for metadata exploration and visualization

## Phase 7: Integration & System Optimization (Weeks 12-13)

- [ ] Integrate GPU diagnostic metrics (validated by test_gpu.py) to dynamically optimize processing
- [ ] Seamlessly integrate all components into a cohesive, end-to-end pipeline
- [ ] Optimize performance for both GPU and CPU processing and implement parallel processing strategies
- [ ] Develop advanced caching strategies and a unified progress reporting system
- [ ] Implement robust error handling, recovery, and comprehensive logging
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for processing large videos

## Phase 8: Testing & Refinement (Weeks 14-15)

- [ ] Conduct comprehensive integration testing across all pipeline components
- [ ] Perform detailed usability testing with real-world videos
- [ ] Optimize UI responsiveness and overall system performance
- [ ] Identify and resolve edge cases and bugs
- [ ] Enhance error messages and user feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Update and extend documentation based on testing results
- [ ] Create example projects and demo videos to showcase end-to-end functionality

## Phase 9: Deployment & Distribution (Week 16)

- [ ] Package the application for distribution, including dependency management and environment setup
- [ ] Create installer scripts and guides for end users
- [ ] Develop comprehensive user documentation and a quick-start guide
- [ ] Implement an update mechanism for future releases
- [ ] Prepare video tutorials and demos to assist with user onboarding
- [ ] Finalize and release version 1.0

## Future Enhancements (Post v1.0)

- [ ] Extend multi-language support for transcription and UI components
- [ ] Explore custom training for domain-specific scene detection
- [ ] Develop a web-based deployment option for broader accessibility
- [ ] Integrate cloud storage for scalable video management
- [ ] Enable batch processing for multiple videos simultaneously
- [ ] Develop an API for third-party integration and automation
- [ ] Create a mobile companion app for on-the-go video analysis
